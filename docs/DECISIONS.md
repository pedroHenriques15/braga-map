# Decisions

Why the map, and the cities games draw from it, are built this way. A change of mind is a new
entry that names the one it replaces; old entries stay as they were. The earlier decisions on
the zones and landmarks, taken on the shared map page, are in `map/decisions.json`.

## 001 · The goal: Braga as close to real life as possible

*2026-10-13*

The owner and their friends want to recognise their city: each street as wide as it is, each
building where it stands, at its height and colour, the hills, the trees, the landmarks and the
street furniture as they are. Everything on the roadmap serves that. Where a game departs from
real life, it's on purpose and listed in decision 004.

One roadmap and one set of tasks, kept here, cover both the map's data (this repository) and
the 3D city a game draws from it (today `../party-kart/src/render/`). Each task names its
repository. The data lives here because every game on the map shares it: the kart race first,
a shooter next (decision 003).

## 002 · Photo textures are allowed

*2026-10-13*

party-kart's rule was "no asset files: every texture is drawn on a canvas". For the city it no
longer holds: real photographs and aerial imagery may texture the ground, facades, roofs and
landmarks, wherever they make a place look more like itself. The owner chose this over keeping
textures procedural (lighter, no licences to track) and over allowing photos only on landmarks.

What it costs, and the conditions:

- **Licences.** Only images whose licence allows using them as a texture and publishing the
  result: the owner's and their friends' own photos, and open sources whose terms say so
  (task 005 keeps the register). Each source's credit goes where the README keeps credits, and
  in the game where it credits OpenStreetMap.
- **Size.** Photos weigh far more than canvas textures. They're compressed, streamed by tile,
  and sized per quality tier, inside the budget of task 004, so phones still play. How is task
  007's.
- **party-kart's docs** (`CLAUDE.md`, the README's "nothing to maintain") change to say so, in
  a party-kart session (task 007).

## 003 · Where the detail goes first: the track, and Fujacal for the shooter

*2026-10-13*

The scripts keep working for the whole map, but hand work (measuring, photographing,
modelling) goes first to two places:

- **The Volta dos Amigos**, and what can be seen from it.
- **Fujacal and Conselheiro Lobato,** where the first shooter game will take place: the Rua do
  Fujacal, the Travessa and the Alameda do Fujacal, the Rua and the Travessa Conselheiro Lobato.
  On the map that's about x −350…350 and z 600…1050, 700 × 450 m, in tiles `x-1z1`, `x0z1`,
  `x-1z2` and `x0z2` (task 015 settles the edge). A shooter is played on foot, so this area
  needs detail at walking distance: doors, windows, walls, kerbs and steps where they are. The
  track's start line is on the Rua do Fujacal, so the two overlap.

The rest of the map gets what the scripts can make from data alone. The owner chose this over
the track alone and over the whole map evenly.

## 004 · Where games depart from real life, on purpose

*2026-10-13*

- **Bom Jesus and the Sameiro are twice their real size** in the kart race
  (`party-kart/src/render/sights.ts`, `FAR_SCALE`), so they read 3–4 km away through the haze.
  The owner chose readability over accuracy here (2026-10-13). A shooter may draw them at their
  real size.
- **The track is never narrower than 9 m** (`W_MIN` in `tools/osm.mjs`), so eight karts and a
  row of item boxes fit. The world's own streets keep their real widths; only the race widens
  them.
- **The friends' houses are never at their real door.** An easter egg stands near a waypoint,
  44–50 m past it (`tools/track.mjs`), and the waypoints stay in `.cache/places.json`.

Anything else that looks different from the real place is a bug, and belongs in a task.

## 005 · "Looks like Braga" is judged on a shared scorecard

*2026-10-13*

The owner and their friends know Braga; a script doesn't. So realism is measured at fixed
viewpoints (task 001): each one a real photo beside a screenshot from the same place, height
and heading, on a shared page where they rate how much it looks like Braga and say what's wrong
(task 003). The screenshots are shot again after every task that changes the look (task 002),
so each round shows whether it got closer. The owner chose this over sending screenshots in the
chat case by case.

## 006 · Which sources may be used, and for what

*2026-10-13*

What each source's terms allow, as read on 2026-10-13 (task 005 has the details, and
`docs/SOURCES.md` the credits, once it exists):

- **Use freely, with credit:** OpenStreetMap (ODbL), DGT's LiDAR, orthophotos and land use
  (CC BY 4.0, credit "Informação geográfica cedida pela Direção-Geral do Território"),
  Copernicus data, and Microsoft's building footprints (CDLA-Permissive-2.0). Data derived from
  them may go into the world's tiles and be published.
- **Photos by the owner and the friends:** theirs to use, as references and as textures, with
  their consent. The first choice for textures and the scorecard.
- **Wikimedia Commons:** each photo under its own licence. As a reference, always. As a
  texture, with its credit; a CC BY-SA photo makes the texture CC BY-SA. Portugal's freedom of
  panorama covers buildings and sculptures in public places, naming the architect.
- **Mapillary:** its photos (CC BY-SA) as references, with its credit and link. Its detected
  map features (signs, lamps) are under Mapillary's own revocable terms: never copied into
  this repository. They may guide someone mapping those things in OpenStreetMap, which then
  brings them here.
- **Never, for anything that ends up in the map or a game:** Google (Maps, satellite, Street
  View, 3D Tiles: its terms forbid creating data or content from them), Esri World Imagery and
  Bing (only for tracing into OSM in an OSM editor). Nothing is recorded from Street View, not
  even by hand.

The alternative, using whatever looks best, would put the map at risk of being taken down, and
it's meant to be shared by games.

## 007 · DGT's data is fetched with the owner's account and stays out of the repository

*2026-10-13*

DGT's LiDAR, orthophoto and land use (decision 006) are fetched by `tools/fetch.mjs` into
`.cache/dgt/`, which git ignores (about 1.8 GB), and read by `tools/dgt.mjs` with dev dependencies
only (`geotiff`, `proj4`, `laz-perf`, `jpeg-js`). Nothing ships to games as it is: what a task
makes from it goes into the world's tiles, with DGT's credit. `docs/SOURCES.md` has the details.

- **The account.** The LiDAR's downloads need a free account at DGT's CDD. It's the owner's,
  kept out of git in `.cache/credentials.json`, and `fetch.mjs` logs in with it. The owner chose
  this over setting it in environment variables and over downloading the tiles by hand. The
  orthophoto and the land use need no account. Mapillary's token, when it's wanted, is task
  001's to ask for.
- **The grid.** DGT's data is in EPSG:3763. ETRS89 is taken as WGS84 (EPSG's transformation
  1149), as DGT's own server does, and `test/sources.test.js` checks that the Praça da República
  lands at (0, 0) within 1 m in the orthophoto and in the LiDAR.
- **The orthophoto** comes from DGT's open WMS as JPEG at 25 cm, on the LiDAR's 1 km tiles. Its
  TIFF is 18 times the size, and its PNG has only 256 colours.

The alternative, committing the data, or cuts of it, would make the package gigabytes for every
game that installs it.
